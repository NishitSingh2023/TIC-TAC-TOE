**This is my version of the infamous `TIC TAC TOE` game**
***
This program is made in python 3 and uses the _turtle_ library of python to to show case the board on a diff window

In this game you as a `Player` is to play against the `Computer`(just a bunch of if statements ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) 
***

## For the best experience numpad is used to input the command i.e.

-|c1|c2|c3
-|-|-|-
r1|7|8|9
r2|4|5|6
r3|1|2|3

## TroubleShooting 
- PLease remember that screen is **NOT CLICKABLE** if you click the screen with the board, the game might freeze.

- You have to enter your commands **IN THE TERNIMAL** for the board to function properly

- Do not forget to press **ENTER** after your command
